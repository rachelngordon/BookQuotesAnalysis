# BookQuotesAnalysis
I am a big reader and a big fan of underlining quotes that stick out to me as well. There's something special about hearing someone else articulate your own thoughts or feelings that you didn't even know how to express before.

This project seeks to take the quotes I have underlined in the books I've read this past year and look for common themes and topics among them.

Steps Include:
- Topic Modeling on All Quotes
- Hashtag Generation using Cohere API
- Visualize Top 5 Most Frequent Hashtags
- Create Word Clouds for Hashtags Extracted from Each Book
