0,"Today the successes are less spectacular, the cries harder to deny, the promise of utopia ""just around the corner"" more hollow, but we still act as though more control were the answer.",The Ascent of Humanity,Charles Eisenstein,2021-12-27, #controlfreak
1,"As relationships develop, the human brain gains an increasingly sophisticated understanding of one another's speech patterns.

10,"The world vibrates with an unspeakable richness of sound and color. As soon as we try to explain, interpret, or exploit that state, we distance ourselves from immediate reality and the experience vanishes.",The Ascent of Humanity,Charles Eisenstein,2021-12-27, #vibrate

12,"Written words foster the illusion that they have objective meanings—definitions—not contingent on the state of speaker and listener...In the same vein, books concretize the belief that knowledge is to be found outside the individual.",The Ascent of Humanity,Charles Eisenstein,2021-12-27, #knowledge
13,"When feeling shame, our inward focus overrides our ability to think about another person's experience. We become unable to offer empathy. We are incapable of processing information about the other person, unless that information specifically pertains to their view of us.",Atlas of the Heart,Brene Brown,2022-01-10, #shame
14,"When we can say what a thing is, or what we are doing, we think we fully grasp and experience it. In point of fact this verbalization—very often it is nothing more than verbalization—tends to cut us off from genuine experience and to obscure our understanding instead of increasing it.",New Seeds of Contemplation,Thomas Merton,2022-02-01, #quotes
15,"To be a writer-translator is to value both being and becoming. What one writes in any given language typically remains as is, but translation pushes it to become otherwise.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #translator
16,"I’m forced to acknowledge that there is a distance between me and both languages…Writing in another language reactivates the grief of being between two worlds, of being on the outside. Of feeling alone and excluded.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #writing
17,"It makes me understand, and appreciate, that the inability to see clearly and fully can illuminate the world in a different way. Despite the distance, it can permit me to strike at the heart of things.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #itmakesmeunderstand

19,"I also ask myself: Who possesses a language, and why? Is it a question of lineage? Mastery? Use? Affect? Attachment? What does it mean, in the end, to belong to a language?",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #language
20,"…In spite of diligent efforts to organize experiences, emotions, memories, they can’t be packaged, hidden, repressed, filed away…For dreams both contain and set free the roiling matter of our psyches.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #dreams

22,"Writing is a way to salvage life, to give it form and meaning. It exposes what we have hidden, unearths what we have neglected, misremembered, denied. It is a method of capturing, of pinning down, but it is also a form of truth, of liberation.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #writing

25,"The desire to translate—to press up as closely as possible to the words of another, to cross the threshold of one’s consciousness—is keener when the other remains inexorably, incontrovertibly out of reach.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #translation
26,"We write books in a fixed moment in time, in a specific phase of our consciousness and development. That is why reading words written years ago feels alienating. You are no longer the person whose existence depended on the production of those words. But alienation, for better or for worse, establishes distance, and grants perspective, two things that are particularly crucial to the act of self-translation.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #translation
27,"We must enter, instead, into a more profound relationship with words—we must descend with them to a deeper level, uncovering layers of alternatives in a hidden and hermetic realm. The only way to even begin to understand language is to love it so much that we allow it to confound us and to torment us to the extent that it threatens to swallow us whole.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #torment

29,…One realizes that every interpersonal relationship can be read as a form of translation.,Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #translation
30,"The knowledge of several languages and the ability, therefore, to express in one language what cannot be said in another, or cannot at least be expressed so succinctly or concisely, or which we cannot find as quickly in another language, makes it easier for us to articulate our thoughts and to understand ourselves, and to apply the word to the idea, which, without that application, would remain confused in our minds.",Translating Myself and Others,Jhumpa Lahiri,2022-06-29, #language
31,"Worse still, I felt then, was the betrayal of language in translation. Why didn't English have a better word than ""Word"" if ""Word"" was not precise enough? I started to approach my Bible with suspicion. What else had I missed?",Transcendent Kingdom,Yaa Gyasi,2022-07-19, #word
32,"And now that you have learned that something you thought was true was never true at all, every idea that you hold firm comes into question. If the Earth is round, then is God real? Literalism is helpful in the fight against change.",Transcendent Kingdom,Yaa Gyasi,2022-07-19, #change

44,There's a certain way I talk about the things I don't talk about. Maybe that's true for all of us. We have ways of closing off the conversation so that we don't ever get directly asked what we can't bear to answer.,The Anthropocene Reviewed,John Green,2022-08-08, #whatshouldwesay

46,"As Elaine Scarry argues in her book The Body in Pain, physical pain doesn't just evade language. It destroys language. When we are really hurting, after all, we can't speak. We can only moan and cry/",The Anthropocene Reviewed,John Green,2022-08-08, #bodyinpain
47,"Even though I myself had the pain, I can't fully empathize with the me who had it, because now I am a different me, with different pangs and discomforts. I am grateful that my head doesn't hurt, but not in the way I would have been grateful if, in the midst of the pain, it had suddenly disappeared.

49,"Like any magic, you have to be careful with a magical song—listen to it too often, and it will become routine. You'll hear the chord changes before they come, and the song will lose its ability to surprise and teleport you. But if I'm judicious with a magical song, it can take me back to places more vividly than any other form of memory.",The Anthropocene Reviewed,John Green,2022-08-08, #magical
50,"I'm forty-one. For Sarah and me, the song now sounds like being in love all those years ago, when we were each other's new partners, and it also sounds like our love now. It's a bridge between that life and this one. We're playing ""New Partner"" for our now nine-year-old son for the first time, and Sarah and I can't help but smile a little giddily at each other. We start dancing together slowly in the kitchen despite our son's gagging noises, and we sing along, Sarah on-key and me way off-. At the end of the song, I ask my son if he liked it and he says, ""A little.""",The Anthropocene Reviewed,John Green,2022-08-08, #newpartner
51,"After one of my books became commerically successful, for instance, my bank called to inform me that I would no longer be charged ATM fees, even if I used an ATM from a different bank. Why? Because people with money in the bank get all kinds of perks just for having money in the bank. Then there are the much bigger power-ups, like the graduating-from-college-with-no-debt-power-up, or the being-white-power-up, or the being-male-power-up. This doesn't mean that people with good power-ups will succeed, of course, or that those without them won't. But I don't buy the argument that these structural power-ups are irrelevant. The fact that our political, social, and economic systems are biased in favor of the already rich and the already powerful is the single greatest failure of the American democratic ideal. I have benefited from this, directly and profoundly, for my entire life. Almost every time I've driven through a question box in my life, I've been given at the very least a red turtle shell. It happens so routinely that it's easy for those of us who benefit from these power-ups to see them as fair. But if I don't grapple with the reality that I owe much of my success to injustice, I'll only further the hoarding of wealth and opportunity.",The Anthropocene Reviewed,John Green,2022-08-08, #powerup

53,"You read it to her, a few weeks after you met. It wasn't the first piece you read but it was more honest, it was more you. It was trauma, yes, but it was you and you were OK with her consuming it. You handed her the work and that was sufficient. You didn't need to explain to her that you felt joy too, that you were angry, you were scared, that walking home in the night worried you sometimes, because you didn't know which fate would meet you, the one who looked like you or the one who couldn't see you, or couldn't see you as you were meant to be seen, or whether you would arrive home without incident, and live to fear another day.",Open Water,Caleb Azumah Nelson,2022-08-10, #writing

56,"Love as a form of meditation; reaching towards a more honest expression of self. Remember that your body has memory. Scars do not always blemish. You kiss them and call her pretty. You're always surprised by the substance of her under your fingers. You want to lie beside her in the darkness and whisper your truths to her: To my queen, forever is a mighty long time, but I knew you before I met you, so now we're free. You didn't have a home coming into this world, but you're home now. You're home now.",Open Water,Caleb Azumah Nelson,2022-08-10, #home

58,"You open your mouth to speak, and your body begins to shake and wobble. You open your mouth to speak, but you don't have the words. Your brother knows what it is like to not have the words, and he can see the panic rising in your body, he can see that you're about to start gulping for air, he sees there are tears on the way, so he holds you, he holds you close, he holds you with care. You allow yourself to be held, as you have done for him before. You allow yourself to be soft and childlike in his arms. You allow yourself to break.",Open Water,Caleb Azumah Nelson,2022-08-10, #brothers

60,"Mother also used the money to improve herself as a midwife.

62,"I squared my stance, ready to argue, to tell Grandma again that we didn't use soap, but when I looked up, the woman I saw was not the woman I expected to see. She didn't seem frivolous, didn't seem like the type who'd waste an entire day fretting over her white carpet. In that moment she was transformed. Maybe it was something in the shape of her eyes, the way they squinted at me in disbelief, or maybe it was the hard line of her mouth, which was clamped shut, determined. Or maybe it was nothing at all, just the same old woman looking like herself and saying the things she always said. Maybe her transformation was merely a temporary shift in my perspective—for that moment, perhaps the perspective was his, that of the brother I hated, and loved.",Educated,Tara Westover,2022-08-18, #StandUp

65,"I'm only crying from the pain, I told myself. From the pain in my wrist. Not from anything else. This moment would define my memory of that night, and of the many nights like it, for a decade. In it I saw myself as unbreakable, as tender as stone. At first I merely believed this, until one day it became the truth. Then I was able to tell myself, without lying, that it didn't affect me, that he didn't affect me, because nothing affected me. I didn't understand how morbidly right I was. How I had hollowed myself out. For all my obsessing over the consequences of that night, I had misunderstood the vital truth: that its not affecting me, that was its effect.",Educated,Tara Westover,2022-08-18, #nightslikethat

67,"I said nothing, I'd never heard anyone criticize my father except Shawn, and I wasn't able to respond to it. I wanted to tell Charles about the Illuminati, but the words belonged to my father, and even in my mind they sounded awkward, rehearsed. I was ashamed at my inability to take possession of them.

70,"But however I chose to remember it, that event would change everything. Reflecting on it now I'm amazed by it, not by what happened, but that I wrote what happened.

When other students asked where I was from, I said, ""I'm from Idaho,"" a phrase that, as many times as I've had to repeat it over the years, has never felt comfortable in my mouth.

75,"It was crucial that I not look at him. As long as I kept my eyes on the spire, I almost believed he couldn't touch me. Almost. Because even while I clung to this belief, I waited to feel his hands on my neck. I knew I would feel them, and soon, but I didn't dare do anything that might break the spell of waiting. In that moment part of me believed, as I had always believed, that it would be me who broke the spell, who cause it to break.

79,"Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was thr price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now.

88,taking a moment to figure out how you really feel instead of letting old patterns decide for you is one of the most authentic things you can do,clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #authenticity
89,"sometimes a person ends a good relationship because the areas they think are bad are being intensified by their personal issues that they have not dealt with properly, sometimes people break apart a home because they are unaware of their projections and are not ready to appreciate a good thing.",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #goodrelationship
90,"we often hand our tension over to others without understanding that it wasn't ours to begin with. someone passed it to us, and so we pass it to the next person, and they do the next, until it lands in the hands of someone with the tools to process it and let it go. the more of us who are open to inner work, the more points there will be in the giant web of humanity where harm will not be able to spread. the self-awareness needed to stop causing ourselves and others harm is not just about knowing our own inner mechanics, our trauma, the moments when we are projecting, or how our reactions impact our perceptions. it is also about taking the time to understand what society has encoded in our minds without our explicit permission.",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #mentalhealth
91,when healing gets deep there is sometimes an explosion of emotion that occurs to clear out old energetic debris. you feel most agitated right before you settle into a more substantial peace,clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #emotion
92,"people are incredibly similar and different at the same time. we all have the same basic structure of mind and emotions, but we have distinct mental conditioning because no two people have experienced the same exact life. the twists and turns, the reactions we have felt, the things we have understood and misunderstood, all that we have come to believe, how we perceive ourselves and the world, the maze of patterns that impact our behavior, the different magnitudes of trauma—you can go on and on and see that each individual has their own inner world and unique emotional history.",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #emotionalhistory
93,"a real conversation free from projection and ego-flexing is a special gift most do not talk to listen, they talk to be heard self-awareness, selflessness, and a real desire to listen are required for mutually authentic and honest exchange",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #listen
94,"miscommunication and conflict occur because we are not building a bridge of understanding. often, in heated conversations, all we can think about is our own perspective, emotions, or ego. this limits our ability to empathize with the experience of another person, which is a prerequisite for the harmony that comes from understanding. one of the greatest gifts we can give each other is selfless listening, which is hearing someone's truth without projecting one's own emotion or story onto it—literally receiving another's perspective with complete acceptance. in special moments, we can take turns deeply seeing one another. here we move beyond having an exchange to holding space while someone reveals their truth. this is a higher level of listening that involves acting as a compassionate audience for another person without interrupting or adding our own perspective. when we hold space for one another, hearts become more open, truth is ready to be revealed, and old tension comes to the surface so that it can be seen and held, not just by the speaker, but also the listener. this collective honoring of each other's truth can be incredibly healing.",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #holdspace
95,"it is okay to not have the answer. one of the bravest things you can do is boldly embrace the unknown, accept your fear, and continue to move forward. a clear mission does not always have a clear path",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #clearmission
96,self-awareness is noticing the rhythm of your thoughts. feeling when they are clear and when they are out of sync. knowing when to take them seriously and when to let them go. not every thought is valuable; most are just the sounds of impulsive emotional reactions,clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #thoughts
97,"so much of our internal struggle comes from not embracing change. tension decreases when we understand that change is happening at every level, from the atomic, to the biological, to the mental. a human being is composed of moving parts. our identity is no different. it is a dynamic phenomenon, similar to a river—flowing, moving, expanding, roaring, weaving, all the time with power and all the time with the potential to change. do not limit yourself to a static understanding of who you are. release your conditioned boundaries and be free.",clarity & connection,yung pueblo,2022-08-13, #change
98,"you cannot build a deep connection with someone who is disconnected from themselves. when we are in the habit of ignoring what we feel or consistently run away from hard parts of ourselves, distance is created not just between us and ourselves but also between us and other people. our lack of a full embrace of all that we are can make our interactions with others superficial. even if there is a desire to connect deeply with someone, that connection will encounter limits and will only ever reach a depth equal to the relationship we have with ourselves. our personal degree of self-awareness will reflect dimly or brightly on whomever crosses our path.

101,"At school, we had to be kind and respectful to each other, because Ms. Pierce made us act like a loving family, but back at the building, we pretended we couldn't stand one another; none of us really knew what to do with the actual affection that we felt. It seemed like a flaw to have these emotions. We didn't know then that the practice of burying emotions created adults who'd struggle to build meaningful relationships; some of us would eventually completely forget how to access true feelings. In my family, we expressed love in many ways, reaching out to touch an arm in a sad moment, or smothering one another in a hug, but I knew, even from a very young age, that this behavior was rarely meant for people outdoors.",Last Summer on State Street,Toya Wolfe,2022-08-29, #family
